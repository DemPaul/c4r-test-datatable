# DataTable JavaSwing Application
> Test task from C4R

This is a simple application to create a datatable using the user interface 
and then write this data into a file for later reading and using this data in this app.  
The reflections library was used to create instances of all classes that implement 
the Field interface while the program runtime, and further work was performed 
using all created field classes. Therefore, to add a new field to the form and table 
it is enough to create a new class that implements the Field interface.  
JUnit tests added to test the validity of field validator methods.

To launch the web application run the <b>c4r-test-swing-datatable.jar</b> file.
